What TwitLib current does...

= Introduction =

TwitLib is currently in a functioning stage which allows a user to make calls to the library which will in-turn make POST/GET requests to Twitter and will return with a message and a status code for the action request. 

Currently the messages sent back from TwitLib are in XML and are to be parsed by the GUI developer, I would like this library to eventually return a kind of linked list to the caller that way no XML parsing will be needed and the information will be in a easy to access type of object.

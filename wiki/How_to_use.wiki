How to use TwitLib

= Introduction =

* ITwitReply.h - An interface file which a GUI app should derive from and override 
                 it's methods for callbacks for TwitLib.

* Server.h     - File containing responses which are given from TwitLib, as well as
                 optional structures which are used when specific information is 
                 requested from Twitter.

* TwitLib.h    - This is the main header file which shows all available routines for
                 interacting with Twitter at a high level.


1. Include the library 'Twit' to your GUI application (i.e. -lTwit).
2. Make sure you create a class which derives from ITwitReply which object 
   should be passed into TwitLib's constructor.
3. Include the TwitLib.h header file to be able to call the desired 
   routines.
4. Include the Server.h header file in order to use the options available 
   for certain routines.
